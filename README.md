# Using someone else's Vue component tutorial examples

This is the example from my tutorial on using someone else's Vue components.

* The **follow-along** folder has the starting example app so you can code on
  to follow along with the tutorial.
* To see the final product of the tutorial, go to the **final-product** folder.
* To see my answer to the challenge question, check out the
  **challenge-answer** folder.

The apps use [vue-cli](https://cli.vuejs.org/), and you can run them with
`yarn serve` and use the app by going to `localhost:1123`.
